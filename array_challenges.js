    Task 1: Movie Titles and Ratings 🎥 (`.map`)
    
    Your manager asks you to display a list of all movie titles and their ratings 
    for a promotional email campaign.
    
    Steps:
    1. Use `.map` to create a new array where each item is a string in this format:
       "[title] - Rating: [rating]/10"
    2. Log the resulting array.
    
    Expected Output:
    [
      "Fast & Furious 10 - Rating: 7.5/10",
      "The Notebook - Rating: 8.0/10",
      "Spider-Man: No Way Home - Rating: 8.7/10",
      "Superbad - Rating: 7.0/10",
      "The Dark Knight - Rating: 9.0/10",
      "The Intern - Rating: 7.4/10"

  Task 2: Find Highly Rated Movies 🌟 (`.filter`)
  
  Your customers have requested a list of **highly rated movies** 
  (movies with a rating of 8.0 or higher).
  
  Steps:
  1. Use `.filter` to create a new array containing only the movies with a rating >= 8.0.
  2. Log the resulting array.
  
  Expected Output:
  [
